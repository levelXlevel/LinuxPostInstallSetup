# Linux Post Install Setup

## Problem

Anytime I install/re-install Linux on a piece of hardware (mine or someone elses) there is usually some level of post-installation configuration needed in order to make better use of the system. Rather than maintaining a stash of documents all to myself, I figured I'd learn a few new things (git, mkdocs, yml, markdown) and try to create something more accessible.

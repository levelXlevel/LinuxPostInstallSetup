# Fonts

For some, fonts can make or break the user experience; for others, not so much. We all have our preferences so pick and chose fonts according to your needs & liking. The list below is primarily directed at helping maintain a consistent experience across applications and platforms. You can find other resources which go on extensively about fonts; that's not the goal here.

# The very short list

- ttf-ms-fonts
- ttf-google
  - This is a large package so you may want to consider font-specific packages if space or bandwidth is a concern.
  - You get a look at the fonts [here](https://fonts.google.com/).
- ttf-google-sans
